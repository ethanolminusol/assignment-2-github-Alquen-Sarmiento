# DTP Assignment 2

The second DTP assignment is all about the `GitHub`. It is divided into two parts.

## Part 1: Share your poem
You will have to create a poem in `src/poem.txt` and push it to your repository. The poem must have at least **20** non-empty lines, including the title.

Note that since the repository is generated publicly, it will be visible to other DTP participants.

## Part 2: Contribute to others' poems
You will have to create at least **3** a pull request to others' poem. Possible contribution includes correcting grammar/spelling, adding title/more lines, substituting words, etc.

Note that a pull request is only counted as your contribution when merged by the owner of the repository.
